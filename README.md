# Cybersecurity-Portfolio
Collection of cybersecurity labs, notes, and project work as I grow my skills.

## Setting Up Basic Home Cybersecurity Lab
### In this project I built a basic cybersecurity lab using VirtualBox and Kali Linux to practice penetration testung and network security skills in a safe enviroment.

## Tools Used 
Oracle VirtualBox (virtualization platform)

Kali Linux (penetration testing distribution)

Windows 10 VM (target practice)

Host Machine (Windows)

## Steps Taken 

### 1. Installed Virtual Box 
Downloaded and installed Oracle VirtualBox on my host machine.

### 2. Downloaded Kali Linux ISO 
Retrieved the latest Kali Linux ISO from the offical website.

### 3. Created a Kali Linux VM 
Allocated 2GB RAM, 2 CPUs, and 20GB storage.

Installed Kali Linux inside the VM and set up basic tools (nmap, metasploit, wireshark)

### 4. Set up target machine
Installed a Windows 10 VM

### 5. Created an Internal Network
Configured VirtualBox Networking to "internal network" so that VM can communicate but are not touching the Internet.

### 6. Performed Inital Scans 
Used nmap to discover open ports 

Practiced running basic vulnerability scans.
